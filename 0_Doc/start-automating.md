# Start automating

Once the [MCP server](/setup-server) and [extension](/setup-extension) have been set up, you can start using Browser MCP to automate your browser.

## Run a command

To test out the extension, open your MCP client (e.g. Cursor) and run the following command:

```
Go to google.com and search for "Browser MCP"
```
